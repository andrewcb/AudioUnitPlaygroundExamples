These are the Xcode playgrounds from the presentation on 29/1/2019, demonstrating some ways of loading and playing AudioUnit instruments on macOS. 

Some of these use proprietary AudioUnits (Native Instruments FM8 and Massive, Roland Cloud JV-1080 and Korg M1), which will not work unless these are installed on the system; these either have options not involving these or logic for gracefully falling back to built-in General MIDI sounds.
